            <p>Queridos,
I don’t spend much time on social media but I thought this would be a good place to share some exciting news from me and Aaron. We are getting ready to pursue a long-held dream for our family - the Great American Road Trip. We’re taking a year off work and planning to travel and camp and visit people we love and explore as much of this great big glorious country as we can. We are going to “road school” the kids and let our travels be our teacher. We’ve bought a beautiful little sunny yellow popup camper, which the kids have named “Lemonade,” and we’re getting ready to leave in July. 

For the past 10 years we’ve lived in Massachusetts on Cape Cod. It is a stunningly beautiful place to live and there are many dear friends we will be sad to say goodbye to. But 10 years of small-town New England village life has left us longing for new landscapes. We want to meet new people, reconnect with family and friends we haven’t seen in a long time, and experience the vastness of this incredible country. 

Several friends have asked us, “why now?” Well, after a very tough year last year, we decided why not now? Aaron turned 40 in October and I’ll be 40 in June. The kids are the perfect ages (old enough to be independent and young enough to still think spending time together as a family is the best thing ever), so what are we waiting for? 

Another friend asked me recently if this is the right time in our nation’s history to be taking such a trip. With all the ugliness we see in the media, I think this is exactly the right time. We want to teach our kids, and remind ourselves, how generous and kind and friendly and open-minded most people are. We are being told daily, in many subtle ways, that the world is a frightening place. That it’s an unsafe place. That it’s a place where you have to look out for you and yours above all else. We reject that kind of fear mongering. There are things that I’m afraid of, rattlesnakes and climate change to name a couple, but my fellow Americans aren’t one of them. 

What do we plan to do for a year on the road? We want to visit all the national parks we can and be awed and inspired by their beauty. We want to hike and sleep under the stars and visit museums and better understand American history, but mostly we want to spend time with people we care about. We are fortunate to know folks all over the country and this letter is to let you know that, if you’ll have us, we’re coming to visit. 

Our spiritual life is also super important to us and we want to experience different faith communities around the country and see how folks are living out their faith by loving and serving each other. 

And food - local, sustainable, nourishing food! For the past 10 years we’ve been happily homesteading on our ¼ acre of land, with our chickens, bees, vegetable and fruit gardens. We are passionate about supporting local farms and eating food from sources we know and trust. It will be hard to leave behind our mini-farm and our local food sources, but we are excited to find local food experiences wherever we go. 

So, let us know if we can stop by if we’re in your neck of the woods. If we come to visit you, take us to a farmers’ market, take us with you to church or temple or wherever you worship. Tell us how you’re doing and where you find joy in the world. We can’t wait to see you.

Love,
Kate & Aaron
